For 
```lua
local recipes = getRecipes()
```
The output is formated as follows:
recipes[`recipeType`][`recipeNumber`][`'in'`/`'out'`]\
For `input` items:
 - shaped recipes will list items as [x][y][options]
 - shapless recipes will list items as [x][options]

### getScreen

**getScreen()**


Returns a new `image` with controls with the pixel data being a screenshot of the game.

### getSettings

**getSettings()**

Returns a table containing any mod settings and controls for Minecraft settings.

Some useful stuff:
`getSettings().editor.colors.textFill` controls the background color in the editor. (Transparent colors are allowed)
All of the mod's colors are defined in the settings and can be changed to whatever you like.

`getSettings().chat.maxLines` Controls the number of lines the chat can store before it starts removing messages. By default Minecraft has this as `100`. Changing this can be useful for looking at large tables in chat.
A good number to use would be `1000`.

<div class="note warning">Making the <code>maxLines</code> too large may cause lag after many messages accumulate.</div>

`getSettings().scriptBrowser.columns` Controls how many columns are in the file browser. (Too many may cause them to overlap)
`getSettings().profiles` This is the table where each binding profile is saved. You can edit them from here if you want to do so.
`getSettings().minecraft` Returns a table with functions for changing Minecraft settings
